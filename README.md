# NannyCRM
This software was created to help my wife, Sarah Jessica Xavier Pereira to manage her Nanny job.

I pretend with this software to improve my coding skills using Laravel, VueJs and FlexBox.  
I'll not use any CSS Frameworks to make sure All front-end will be done by scratch.  
The only Laravel's "inside the box" library that will use is Sanctum, to provide API keys.  
I pretend to have tests covering at least 95%.
